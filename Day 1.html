    <h2>Understanding Database Management Systems</h2>
    <p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software application that facilitates the creation, retrieval, update, and management of data. It serves as an interface between users, applications, and databases.</p>

    <h3>Data</h3>
    <p>Data refers to raw, unprocessed facts and figures stored in databases. It can include numbers, text, dates, and multimedia files, either structured (like spreadsheets) or unstructured (like text documents and images).</p>

    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p>Information is processed and organized data that provides context and meaning. It is derived through queries, calculations, and reports within a DBMS, enabling informed decision-making.</p>

    <h3>Metadata</h3>
    <p>Metadata describes the structure, operations, and constraints of data within a database. It includes schema definitions, data types, and relationships between tables, facilitating efficient data management and retrieval.</p>

    <h3>Data Dictionary</h3>
    <p>A data dictionary is a repository of metadata that documents the database's structure, including tables, fields, and relationships. It aids administrators and developers in maintaining consistency and understanding the database design.</p>

    <h3>Database</h3>
    <p>A database is an organized collection of structured data stored electronically. Managed by a DBMS, databases support operations such as data insertion, querying, updating, and deletion, ensuring efficient data manipulation.</p>

    <h3>Table</h3>
    <p>A table organizes related data entries into rows and columns within a database. Each table represents an entity (e.g., customers or orders), with columns defining attributes and rows representing individual records.</p>

    <h3>Tuple</h3>
    <p>A tuple, or row, is a single entry in a table representing a data entity. It contains values for each column that define attributes such as name, address, and contact details in a structured format.</p>

    <h3>Field</h3>
    <p>A field, or column, is a data element within a table that defines specific attributes of the entity. Fields in a customer table, for instance, might include ID, name, email, and phone number.</p>

    <h3>Domain</h3>
    <p>A domain specifies the permissible values for a field in terms of type, format, and range. It enforces rules ensuring data integrity and consistency, such as date formats or valid email addresses.</p>

    <h3>Constraint</h3>
    <p>Constraints are rules applied to fields to enforce data integrity and consistency. They restrict data types, enforce uniqueness, and maintain relationships between tables, ensuring accurate and reliable data.</p>

    <h3>Key</h3>
    <p>A key uniquely identifies records within a table. A primary key uniquely identifies each record, while foreign keys establish relationships between tables, ensuring referential integrity and efficient data management.</p>
